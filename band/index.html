        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
            Starting off remixing songs by other artists, Hugo Gruzman and James Lyell officially formed Flight Facilities in 2009. In short time, they had amassed an almost 'cult' following, with fans boasting about their creative intelligence and laid back demeanour.
        </p>
        <p>
            They found themselves performing, and selling out, various venues across Sydney, almost as soon as they began. It didn't take long for them to get bigger, as they began touring around the country, going to larger venues each time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Genre</h3>
        <p>
            As always, its hard to narrow down a band's genre, as they often span over multiple facets. So instead of trying and making a fool of myself, I'll just say that they are an electonic band.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Discography</h3>
        <p>
            It took 5 years for the world to get a taste of Flight Facilities first, and at the time of writing only, studio album. After releasing numerous EPs with great success, the duo wanted to ensure they had the perfect album, before taking it to the streets, and my goodness, it was worth the wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Down to Earth' peaked at number 3 on the Australian charts, with many of their singles (including 'stand still' and 'sunshine' among others) making it into the top 100 charts in Australia.

        <h2>Where next?</h2>
        <p>
            Having released two singles in 2018 ('Need you' and 'All your love'), the rumour mill is buzzing with a potential 2nd studio album, and let me tell you, I'm bloody excited!
